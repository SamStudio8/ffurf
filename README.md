# ffurf

Pronounced "furv" after the Welsh word for "form" or "shape" (and short for the much longer and harder to say Welsh word for configuration), `ffurf` is a very lightweight Python library for defining and loading simple configurations.
`ffurf` is yet another configuration parser and is just a cleaned up version of the code I write over and over for small projects. There is almost certainly [a bigger and better library](http://dynaconf.com/) but I make `ffurf` available in the hope it might be useful to someone who wants a small and non-intrusive way to handle very simple configurations.
